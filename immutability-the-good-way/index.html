    <p>A <strong>mutable</strong> object can be modified after its creation, an <strong>immutable</strong> cannot.</p>
<img alt="parliament-budapest" src="/images/2020-08-20/1.png" style="width: 100%"/>
<p>An immutable object will remain in the same state as it was created. Design and implementation will be much easier and
consistent. In the case of problems, locate a potential bug is faster due that it won't have side effects.</p>
<p>Although, creating immutable objects sometimes require more code, and it doesn't fit in all scenarios (entities need to
be mutable for example).</p>

<p>The ‘&amp;’ operator is used to get a value by reference, which means we are modifying the original value instead of
creating a copy of this element (this is the standard behaviour for primitive types).</p>
<p>The point of Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) is to have immutable objects. Regarding the previous snippet, we have two
alternatives.</p>
<p>On the one hand, is to make private the properties and implement getters, then, in the getter use the clone keyword.</p>

<p>On the other hand, is about a static analyzer code library (such as Psalm), it will complain if you are not taking into
account the PHPDoc that you define.</p>

<p>As you can see, having the <em>@psalm-immutable</em> on your immutable classes you don’t need to worry about any of this
(cloning or getters), and you can even leave your properties public without any fear because they are write-only.</p>
<h2 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Use <em>\DateTimeImmutable</em> over <em>\DateTime</em></li>
<li>Encourage immutability for your <a href="https://codete.com/blog/value-objects/">Value Objects</a>
&amp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transfer_object">Data Transfer Objects</a></li>
<li>Don’t use the ‘&amp;’ character</li>
<li>Introduce a static analyzer tool in your projects (as Psalm or PHPStan)</li>
