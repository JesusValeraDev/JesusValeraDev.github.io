A _RESTful API_ is a de-facto standard to allow communication between applications, although, recently _GraphQL_ comes
up.

From the user-client perspective, _GraphQL_ is similar to _RESTful_, they work as an entry point between different
applications, but _GraphQL_ is slightly different, and because of this, this technology has a reason to be.

## GraphQL vs RESTful API

_GraphQL_ and _RESTful_ have the same foundation. They use the HTTP methods, and they have the idea of resource, but, in
_REST_, each endpoint is a single resource, while in _GraphQL_ there is only a single resource.<br>
_GraphQL_ is not about resource state management, but about separating read operations (queries) from write operations 
(mutations). This is known as
the [Command Query Separation pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command%E2%80%93query_separation).<br>
In _REST_, the server determines the shape and size of a resource, in _GraphQL_ depends on the user's needs.

## How to manage a GraphQL schema?

A schema contains objects, every object has different parameters, and those parameters can be properties or even
sub-objects.

Usually, if you want to filter an object(s) from a specific Type, you can apply a filter into brackets, the output is
always a JSON response.

### Queries

The queries are the _GET_ requests. That means you can only **fetch** data.

### Mutations

The mutations are the _POST_, _PUT_, _PATCH_, and _DELETE_ HTTP methods. That means you can **mutate** the data model,
and persist it in the database by creating, updating or removing elements.

I hope you will be able to write from now on queries and mutations for your GraphQL API, in order to do that first you
should understand the DB architecture and relations between elements, but that is the basic idea.
In the end, it is very similar to how Restful works, but with another syntax.

I recommend you to take a look at the [GraphQL documentation](https://graphql.org/) for more information, not only from
a black-box side perspective but also as a white box and learn more about other elements like `enums`, `interfaces`.<br>
How to create and manage new entities, even building up new architectures.
